                <p class="built">After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million residents, the
                    same area was
                    hit again with record-breaking rainfall that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone
                    underwater again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those still living in
                    temporary shelters and further exposed to extreme weather and waterborne diseases. Most of the
                    affected communities are the ones that are already living in very poor conditions and low economy
                    households. Floods can harm
                    communities by
                    destroying homes, damaging transportation, and producing outages and landslides. Support those who
                    have been impacted by a flood by donating to their fundraiser.</p>
